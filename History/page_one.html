			<h1>World History</h1>
		<h2>Sumeria</h2>
		<p>around <i>5000 BC</i>, farmers settled on the fertile land of southern <b>Mesopotamia</b>(now Iraq) known as <b>Sumer</b>. This formed the world's first great civilisation.<br>
		   Living along the river valleys of the <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigris">Tigris</a></b> and <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphrates">Euphrates</a></b>
		   Sumerian farmers were able to grow grain and other crops, enabling them to settle in one place.<br> Sumerians also traded food for metals with people far away as present day Pakistan and Afganistan.
           They dug a network of ditches and canals as drainage channels on their lands.</p>
		<p>By <i>3000 BC</i> a number of city-states had developed in <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer">Sumer</a></b>, the largest of which was Ur, with a population of <i>40,000.</i> The first known system of writing originated in Sumer.<br>
	       Pictographic writing evolved into a series of simplified wedge-shaped signs formed using reed stalks on clay tablets.</p>

	    <h2>Babylonia</h2>
	    <p>Political powe in Mesopotamia eventually moved north to the city of Babylon in Akkad, so the entire plane became known as Babylonia.<br>
        The first great dynasty of Babylon lasted about 300 years from around <i>1894 BC</i>, reaching the peak of its influence under King Hammurabi.</p>
